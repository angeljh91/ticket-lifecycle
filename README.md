Here is an example of incoming Help Desk tickets received from end users in osTicket. The Life Cycle stages provide a structured way to track the progress of tickets from creation to resolution. It allows both end users and support staff to understand where a ticket stands.
Doing so allows teams to manage workflows more effectively, which reduces chance of oversight.

Here is an example of me updating the priority level of a ticket within osTicket. By adjusting priority levels it helps ensure that support staff are focused on the most urgent issues first, optimizing resource use and response times.

After reviewing this ticket, I updated the Mobile Banking offline issue to be resolved. By updating tickets, it facilitates communication between support staff and users, keeping everyone informed about the status of issues and any steps being taken toward resolution.
